update the user (ubuntu) and the path to startApi.sh in the omniapi.service file to match your system setup.

Copy it to /etc/systemd/system

#reload daemon to see new file
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

#start the service
sudo systemctl start omniapi.service

#stop the service
sudo systemctl stop omniapi.service

#if everything works/checks out then set it to auto start on boot
sudo systemctl enable omniapi.service
